# Arc theme for Regolith DE

WIP

This is the basis for an [Arc theme](https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme) for the [Regolith Desktop Environement](https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-desktop)

So far this is just the file structure taken from the [existing themes](https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-styles). The next steps would be to extract the colours from Arc and apply them to this template.
